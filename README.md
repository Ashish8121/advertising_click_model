# ðŸ“¢ Advertising Click Prediction with Logistic Regression

This machine learning project aims to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement based on various demographic and behavioral features. The model uses **Logistic Regression**, a popular classification algorithm, to analyze the relationship between user attributes and the likelihood of ad engagement.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset consists of user behaviors and ad interaction data. Key features include:
- `Daily Time Spent on Site`
- `Age`
- `Area Income`
- `Daily Internet Usage`
- `Ad Topic Line`
- `City`
- `Clicked on Ad` (target)

### ðŸ“š Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (with libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive workflow
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization

## ðŸ§  Key Steps
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzed features like time spent on site, age, and internet usage.
2. **Model Building**: Built a **Logistic Regression** model to predict ad clicks.
3. **Evaluation**: Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess the modelâ€™s performance.
4. **Visualization**: Generated plots to visualize feature relationships and model results.
